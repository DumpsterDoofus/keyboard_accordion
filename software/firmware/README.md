For C++ intellisense to work, you need to open this directory in VS Code, rather than the parent Git repository (otherwise the PlatformIO libraries will not be found).

For firmware upload to work, you need to install [00-teensy.rules](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/00-teensy.rules) to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, see [these instructions](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_linux.html). Then connect the Teensy via USB, and use PlatformIO's "Upload" action.
