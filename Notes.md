## Key spacing

For the Roland accordion:

* Horizontal spacing is 19.06 mm, which is almost the same spacing as the keys on my mechanical keyboard.
* Vertical spacing is about 15.5 mm (possibly harder to measure due to angling), which is less than the 19.06 mm * sin(2*pi/6) = 16.5 mm spacing of a true hexagonal lattice.

For the Orfey accordion:

* Horizontal spacing is 19.81 mm.
* Vertical spacing is 18.25 mm, which is more than the 19.81 mm * sin(2*pi/6) = 17.16 mm spacing of a true hexagonal lattice.

On the mechanical keyboard, there is a little space between the switches, so we could theoretically make the spacing denser than the Roland, but I don't think this would make sense.

Going to try 800 mil = 20.32 mm horizontal spacing and 800 mil * sin(2*pi/6) = 17.5976 mm vertical spacing.

    88 keys on normal keyboard (MIDI number 21-108 in table), we could do 96 (MIDI Number 17-112, F0-E8, 8 octaves).

    There is also a v2 that is twice the cost but supposedly less wobbly.

    At 40:25 he says (192 keys) / (16 keys/multiplexer) = 12 is more than the number of analog inputs on a Teensy, but according to docs Teensy 4.1 has 18 analog inputs?
    GullSonix Midihex, uses a different layout

        Each can read up to 16 Hall effect sensors, so might have each PCB board have 2 octaves (48 keys) and 3 multiplexers.
    Teensy 4.1 microcontroller https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html

https://github.com/TeensyUser/doc/wiki/ECAD
    Apparently you can create your own Teensy integrated into a larger PCB system, and I suspect that's what the GullSonix guy did.

    Evidently the 18 analog pins are connected to 2 ADC units, but each ADC only connects to a subset of the 18 pins. For best sample rate, will need to connect multiplexers to pins in such a way that we can divide reads across the 2 ADCs and run both in parallel.
    ADC0: A0-A11, A16-A17
    ADC1: A0-A9, A12-A17
    Maybe use ADC1 A0-A5 and ADC0 A6-A11 for the 12 multiplexer inputs?

## Power

The Teensy has a 3.3V output, but a commenter suggested to avoid using it for large current draw (https://forum.pjrc.com/index.php?threads/beginner-schematic-review-hall-effect-keyboard.76407/post-354362). So instead am going to power Teensy with USB, and other components with 5V DC power adapter dropped to 3.3V using a linear regulator.

Hall sensors will likely consume 4.2 mA * 192 keys = 800 mA. Multiplexers supposedly draw less than 1 mA (https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_1810010611_Texas-Instruments-CD74HC4067SM96_C98457.pdf search for "quiescent").
