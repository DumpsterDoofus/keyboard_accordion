# Keycaps

2 types of keycaps, which can be 3D-printed:

* Unweighted keycaps: Plain flat circular keycaps. See [unweighted_keycap.3mf](unweighted_keycap.3mf), downloaded from [here](https://www.printables.com/model/400552-flat-circular-keycaps).
* Weighted keycaps: These contain a [5/8" steel ball](https://www.amazon.com/Inch-Carbon-Steel-Bearings-G500-15/dp/B01AX1N04I) to increase weight, which might ease control of velocity. The total weight is about 18 g (much less than a piano key). There is a bottom and top half. STL files can be generated using [weighted_keycaps.nb](weighted_keycaps.nb). TODO: Commit STL files after testing done, since they are large.
