# Keyboard Accordion

This is a prototype keyboard MIDI controller. It uses a 6-row B-system [chromatic button accordion layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_button_accordion), also known as a "dugmetara". It's inspired by the Midihex (see [here](https://gullsonix.co.uk/) and [here](https://midi.org/innovation-award/midihex)), which instead uses a [Harmonic Table layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_table_note_layout).

Virtually nothing is done yet. Status:

* 3-key prototype
    * Done: Schematic, PCB layout/manufacturing, firmware and electrical testing: Done.
    * TODO: Key plate, case.
* 192-key final version: TODO.
